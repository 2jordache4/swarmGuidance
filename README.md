# swarmGuidance
swarm guidance project for Robot Motion Planning

swarmGuidance is a final project for the class Robot Motion Planning. The objective of our project was to have two quick agents spread across a partially known (using a defualt floor plan) semi-dynamic environment and detect obstacles. This known environment would then be used by a slower agent to path plan using the A* algorithm for a quick and optimal path, and make its way back to it's starting position.
